            The Toyota Supra (Japanese: トヨタ・スープラ, Hepburn: Toyota
            Sūpura) is a sports car and grand tourer manufactured by the Toyota
            Motor Corporation beginning in 1978. The name "supra" is derived
            from the Latin prefix, meaning "above", "to surpass" or "go
            beyond".[3] The initial four generations of the Supra were produced
            from 1978 to 2002. The fifth generation has been produced since
            March 2019 and went on sale in May 2019.[4] The styling of the
            original Supra was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was
            longer.[5] Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate
            model from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also stopped using the prefix
            Celica and named the car Supra.[6] Owing to the similarity and past
            of the Celica's name, it is frequently mistaken for the Supra, and
            vice versa. The first, second and third generations of the Supra
            were assembled at the Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, while the
            fourth generation was assembled at the Motomachi plant in Toyota
            City. The 5th generation of the Supra is assembled alongside the G29
            BMW Z4 in Graz, Austria by Magna Steyr. The Supra traces much of its
            roots back to the 2000GT owing to an inline-6 layout. The first
            three generations were offered with a direct descendant to the
            Crown's and 2000GT's M engine. Interior aspects were also similar,
            as was the chassis code "A". Along with this name, Toyota also
            included its own logo for the Supra. It was derived from the
            original Celica logo, being blue instead of orange. This logo was
            used until January 1986, when the A70 Supra was introduced. The new
            logo was similar in size, with orange writing on a red background,
            but without the dragon design. That logo, in turn, was on Supras
            until 1991 when Toyota switched to its current oval company logo.
            The dragon logo was a Celica logo regardless of what colour it was.
            It appeared on the first two generations of the Supra because they
            were officially Toyota Celicas. The dragon logo was used for the
            Celica line until it was also discontinued.[citation needed] In
            1998, Toyota ceased sales of the fourth-generation Supra in the
            United States.[6] Production of the fourth-generation Supra for
            worldwide markets ended in 2002. In January 2019, the
            fifth-generation Supra, which was co-developed with the G29 BMW Z4,
            was introduced.[7]

            The Ford Mustang is a series of American automobiles manufactured by
            Ford. In continuous production since 1964, the Mustang is currently
            the longest-produced Ford car nameplate. Currently in its seventh
            generation, it is the fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate. The
            namesake of the "pony car" automobile segment, the Mustang was
            developed as a highly styled line of sporty coupes and convertibles
            derived from existing model lines, initially distinguished by "long
            hood, short deck" proportions.[3] Originally predicted to sell
            100,000 vehicles yearly, the 1965 Mustang became the most successful
            vehicle launch since the 1927 Model A.[4] Introduced on April 17,
            1964[5] (16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda), over 400,000 units
            were sold in its first year; the one-millionth Mustang was sold
            within two years of its launch.[6] In August 2018, Ford produced the
            10-millionth Mustang; matching the first 1965 Mustang, the vehicle
            was a 2019 Wimbledon White convertible with a V8 engine.[7] The
            success of the Mustang launch led to multiple competitors from other
            American manufacturers, including the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac
            Firebird[8] (1967), AMC Javelin (1968), and Dodge Challenger[9]
            (1970). It also competed with the Plymouth Barracuda, which was
            launched around the same time. The Mustang also had an effect on
            designs of coupes worldwide, leading to the marketing of the Toyota
            Celica and Ford Capri in the United States (the latter, by
            Lincoln-Mercury). The Mercury Cougar was launched in 1967 as a
            unique-bodied higher-trim alternative to the Mustang; during the
            1970s, it included more features and was marketed as a personal
            luxury car. From 1965 until 2004, the Mustang shared chassis
            commonality with other Ford model lines, staying rear-wheel-drive
            throughout its production. From 1965 to 1973, the Mustang was
            derived from the 1960 Ford Falcon compact. From 1974 until 1978, the
            Mustang (denoted Mustang II) was a longer-wheelbase version of the
            Ford Pinto. From 1979 until 2004, the Mustang shared its Fox
            platform chassis with 14 other Ford vehicles (becoming the final one
            to use the Fox architecture). Since 2005, Ford has produced two
            generations of the Mustang, each using a distinct platform unique to
            the model line. Through its production, multiple nameplates have
            been associated with the Ford Mustang series, including GT, Mach 1,
            Boss 302/429, Cobra (separate from Shelby Cobra), and Bullitt, along
            with "5.0" fender badging (denoting 4.9 L OHV or 5.0 L DOHC V8
            engines).

            The Dodge Challenger is the name of three different generations of
            automobiles produced by American automobile manufacturer Dodge.
            However, the first use of the Challenger name by Dodge was in 1959
            for marketing a "value version" of the full-sized Coronet Silver
            Challenger. From model years 1970 to 1974, the first generation
            Dodge Challenger pony car was built using the Chrysler E platform in
            hardtop and convertible body styles sharing major components with
            the Plymouth Barracuda.[2] The second generation, from model years
            1978 to 1983, was a badge engineered Mitsubishi Galant Lambda /
            Sapporo,[3] a coupe version of an economical compact car. The third
            and current generation is a full-size muscle car that was introduced
            in early 2008 originally as a rival to the evolved fifth generation
            Ford Mustang and the fifth generation Chevrolet Camaro.[4] In
            November 2021, Stellantis announced that 2023 model year would be
            the final model year for both the LD Dodge Charger and LA Dodge
            Challenger, as the company will focus its future plans on electric
            vehicles rather than fossil fuel powered vehicles, due to tougher
            emissions standards required by the Environmental Protection Agency
            for the 2023 model year.[5] Challenger production ended on December
            22, 2023, and the Brampton, Ontario assembly plant will be re-tooled
            to assemble an electrified successor.

            The Nissan Skyline (Japanese: 日産・スカイライン, Hepburn: Nissan
            Sukairain) is a brand of automobile originally produced by the
            Prince Motor Company starting in 1957, and then by Nissan after the
            two companies merged in 1967. After the merger, the Skyline and its
            larger counterpart, the Nissan Gloria, were sold in Japan at
            dealership sales channels called Nissan Prince Shop. The Skyline was
            largely designed and engineered by Shinichiro Sakurai from
            inception, and he remained a chief influence of the car until his
            death in 2011. Skylines are available in either coupé, or sedan body
            styles, plus station wagon, crossover, convertible and pickup/sedan
            delivery body styles. The later models are most commonly known by
            their trademark round brake and tail lights. While not distributed
            in the United States until its importation as the Infiniti G, the
            Skyline's prominence (particularly for the GT-R variant) in video
            games, movies and magazines resulted in many such cars being
            imported there, and makes up a large amount of second-hand Japanese
            car imports to Europe and North America. The majority of Skyline
            models are rear-wheel drive, with all-wheel drive being available
            since the eighth-generation's debut. The eleventh-generation Skyline
            (V35) was another major turning point for the nameplate, as it
            dropped some of the previous generation Skyline's trademark
            characteristics such as the straight-six engine (replaced with a V6)
            and turbocharging (reintroduced in the thirteenth-generation/V37
            model), and eventually separated the GT-R into its own line. Nissan
            decided to retain the Skyline for the luxury-sport market segment,
            while its platform-mate, the 350Z, revived the Z line of pure sports
            cars.[1] The V35 was the first Skyline made for export to North
            America, being sold under Nissan's luxury marque Infiniti as the G35
            in 2002. The Skyline (V36/J50) is sold in Europe, North America,
            South Korea, Taiwan, and the Middle East as the Infiniti G37 and EX
            respectively. As of 2024, the Skyline is the only remaining sedan in
            Nissan's Japanese lineup following the discontinuation of both the
            Fuga and Cima in 2022.

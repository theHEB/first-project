      <h2>Writers : Christopher Nolan, Kai Bird, Martin Sherwin</h2>
      <p style="font-family:cursive;font-size: 20px;">Focusing on the life of American physicist Julius Robert Oppenheimer, the film reveals his role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. When physicist Julius Robert Oppenheimer assumed scientific leadership of the Manhattan Project during World War II, he and his wife, Kitty, could not have imagined that Oppenheimer's work would have such a profound impact not only on their own lives but on the entire world. . Oppenheimer is called the "father of the atomic bomb" after he and his team worked for a long time to develop nuclear weapons at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. However, the use of his fake invention in Hiroshima and Nagasaki caused Oppenheimer to walk away from the project. As the war drew to a close, Robert Oppenheimer, whose father Lewis Strauss may have founded the US Atomic Energy Agency, opposed international control of nuclear energy and the nuclear arms race and was therefore targeted by the US.</p>
